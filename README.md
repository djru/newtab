#Newtab
Newtab is my attempt to solve the issue of effortlessly opening links in new tabs. It allows you to easily toggle between opening all links in a new tab and defaulting to the link's idiosyncratic behavior using the Cmd+Shift+D shortcut. 

It is [available](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/newtab/hlhbgaappelgbbgdmejngepgieocganb) in the Chrome Web Store, and is free.
